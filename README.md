## Get Started
Under [Releases](https://github.com/markus-senger/RoboDKChessGame/releases) you can download the current project state. The download consists of a .zip file containing the Unity chess application (UnityRoboDKChess.exe) on the one hand and the corresponding RoboDK file (AGameOfChess.rdk) on the other hand.

To enable the connection between Unity-Chess and RoboDK-Chess, the "main" program of AGameOfChess.rdk must be started first. Afterwards the green button "Connect to RoboDK" can be pressed in UnityRoboDKChess.exe. Afterwards a connection should be established and AGameOfChess.rdk executes the chess moves specified in UnityRoboDKChess.exe.
